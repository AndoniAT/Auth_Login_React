<h4>Author : Andoni ALONSO TORT</h4>

### React + TypeScript + Vite

Implementing authentication in React with JWT received from server.

A front-end application built with React, designed to provide an intuitive and modern interface for user and role management. It includes:

- ✅ An intuitive user interface for login and user profile management.
- ✅ Role management with specific views and permissions based on user authorizations.
- ✅ Integration with a secure REST API, developed in Node.js, for all authentication and user management operations. Communications use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure exchanges.
- ✅ Support for conditional navigation with protected routes based on user login status and roles.
- ✅ An optimized user experience thanks to modern libraries like React Router and Axios.

This front-end is designed to interact with the [authentication JWT Node.js back-end proejct](https://github.com/AndoniAT/Auth_JWT_NodeJs). Offering a solid and secure foundation for applications requiring advanced user management.

## == 🏠 Home Page ==

On the homepage, there will be a page similar to when starting a new project with React + Vite, except that there will be an additional navbar with navigation buttons.

<div style="flex inline-flex">
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe029448-ce47-44fb-81fd-6f322305aceb" width="300"/>

</div>

## == 🔐 Login ==

Login page to connect to the application. This form calls the login API of the back-end project, which provides an accessToken with a duration of 1 minute and also stores a refreshToken in the cookies.

Each time an API call fails because the token has expired, the application will automatically request a new accessToken. The backend will use the refreshToken stored in the cookies to verify if the user is authorized to make this request

Added a 'Trust this device' checkbox to stay logged into the application.

</div>

## == ✅🧔 Create Account ==

Create an account while following the rules defined in the [Back-end project](https://github.com/AndoniAT/Auth_JWT_NodeJs). Once the account is created, the user will be redirected to the login page.

## == 👨‍💼 Admin Page Users Manage ==

The admin page displays a list of users with action buttons: Edit and Delete.

‼️WARNING: An administrator cannot be deleted if they are the only administrator of the application.

</div>

## == 👨‍💻 User Profile ==

The user profile page is divided into 3 sections:

 - 👁️ Form for viewing, editing, and deleting the user : Actions only displayed in your own profile or if you are an admin.

 - 🤝 Interactions : Are only displayed in other user, not your own profile.

 - 💻 Posts

(Points 2 and 3 are not features of this application. They are just examples of what could be added. This application is designed solely to provide a complete authentication and user management project based on roles.)

# == ✅➕ MORE ==

## == ↪️ REDIRECTIONS (Navigation)  ==

- 🙅 If a user does not have permission to access a page, they will be redirected to the homepage. For example, a regular user attempting to access the admin page.
